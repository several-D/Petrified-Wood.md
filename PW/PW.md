# Hello

Most likely, you are holding in your hands one of the specimens of a petrified tree from the Goderdzi Pass, Adjara, Sakartvelo.
This tree turned to stone about 5-7 million years ago, as a result of powerful volcanic activity of the Tertiary period, which hid the existing tropical forest under lava and ash. Organics went through a path of replacement and crystallization of rocks. It turned into quartz, opals, chalcedones, agates, etc.
