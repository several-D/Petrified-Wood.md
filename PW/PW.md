# Hello

Most likely, you are holding in your hands one of the specimens of a petrified tree from the Goderdzi Pass, Adjara, Sakartvelo.
This tree turned to stone about 5-7 million years ago, as a result of powerful volcanic activity of the Tertiary period, which hid the existing tropical forest under lava and ash. Organics went through a path of replacement and crystallization of rocks. It turned into quartz, opals, chalcedones, agates, etc.

The first known expeditions in 1908-1910 were made after the discovery of fossils by Alexander Florensky (father of philosopher and theologian Pavel Florensky) during the construction of the Batumi-Akhaltsikhe highway (Arsian Ridge). Fossils of plants from the late Pliocene forest were found.

They were palms, magnolia, laurel, birch, hornbeam, beech - all preserved as imprints of semi-fossilized leaves and stems in volcanic tuff.
That followed a series of expeditions that allowed to describe and study the condition   of petrified forest formation in the region. All links to articles, publications and scientific reports can be found below (1).

We also enclose our own materials of searching and finding stones and the results of gemological examination (2023G). For a more detailed study, we have taken some popular specimens to determine their approximate composition.(2)
You can explore the route yourself using our geo-tags (3)
At the moment, fragments of petrified forest can be found on the Batumi-Akhaltsikhe highway, Meskheti region; when you come to the "Natural Monument Goderdzi Petrified Forest" (4) or to the village of Kabardino-Badakhshan (4), you can visit the "Nature Monument Goderdzi Petrified Forest" (3).(4) or by visiting the Batumi Archaeological Museum (Sakartvelo)(5). Some specimens can be found in archaeological museums in the territories of Armenia and Russia.
